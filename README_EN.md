# **Potter Card Game - Complete Rules Guide**

This is an exciting card game using a standard 52-card deck that you can play with friends. The main objective of the game is to form legal melds with the cards in your hand and be the first to finish before everyone else.

### **1. How to Start the Game?**

* **Players:** The game requires between 2 to 5 players.
  > **Example:** You and three friends can play together as a group of four players.

* **Cards:** A standard deck of 52 cards.

* **Dealing:** Each player receives 8 cards.

* **Target Score:** The game starts with a default target of 200 points, but you can adjust it to any value between 50-500 points if desired.

> **Remember the card values:**
> * **A (Ace):** 1
> * **2 through 10:** Face value
> * **J (Jack):** 11
> * **Q (Queen):** 12
> * **K (King):** 13

### **2. Your Goal**

It's quite simple. You need to form legal melds with the cards in your hand, place them on the table, and be the first to finish.

> **Example:** Your hand has the last three cards `[8♣, 9♣, 10♣]`. When your turn comes, if you place this meld on the table and empty your hand, you win that round!

### **3. What to do on Your Turn?**

When your turn arrives, there are specific actions you must follow in order. You must follow these three phases:

1.  **Draw a Card (Draw Phase):**
  * First, take the top card from the draw pile in the center of the table.
  * **Alternatively,** you can take the entire discard pile if you choose.

2.  **Form Melds (Play Phase):**
  * Now, with the card you just drew and the cards in your hand, look for possible melds and place them on the table.
  * If you are 'Sallan', you can also add cards to other players' existing melds.

3.  **Discard a Card (Discard Phase):**
  * Finally, choose a card from your hand that you consider useless, turn it face up for others to see, and place it on the discard pile. Your turn ends here.

### **4. Making Melds**

There are two ways to form melds using at least 3 cards:

* **Sets:** Same rank, but different suits.
  > **Example:** If you have `7♥`, `7♦`, `7♣`, that's a valid 'Set'.

* **Runs:** Same suit, consecutive ranks.
  > **Example:** If you have `5♠`, `6♠`, `7♠`, that's a valid 'Run'.

### **5. What Does Becoming 'Sallan' Mean?**

This is a special status in the game.

* **How to achieve it:** When you place your first valid meld on the table, you become 'Sallan'.
  > **Example:** Until your turn, you haven't placed any melds on the table. When your turn comes, you place the meld `[J♥, Q♥, K♥]` on the table. Since this is your first meld, you are now 'Sallan'.

* **Benefits of becoming 'Sallan':**
  * You can use 'Potter' cards as substitutes for any card.
  * You can add matching cards from your hand to melds that other players have placed on the table.

### **6. The Special Card: 'Potter'**

Each round has a special 'Potter' card.

* **How is it determined?:** The Potter card value is determined by the round number.
  > **Example:** If you're playing **Round 3**, then all **3** cards (`3♠, 3♥, 3♦, 3♣`) become 'Potter' cards for that round.

* **If you're not 'Sallan':** You cannot use 'Potter' cards as substitutes; you can only use them at their face value.
  > **Example:** In Round 3, you have a 'Potter' card (`3♥`). You cannot substitute it like a `Joker` for another card. However, you can combine it with `3♠` and `3♦` to form a 'Set' `[3♥, 3♠, 3♦]`.

* **If you are 'Sallan':** You can substitute 'Potter' cards like `Jokers` for any card.
  > **Example:** You are 'Sallan' in Round 3. You have `8♣, 10♣` and a 'Potter' card (`3♥`). You can substitute `3♥` for `9♣` to form a 'Run' `[8♣, 9♣(substituted by 3♥), 10♣]`.

* **Most Important Rule:** You can never discard a 'Potter' card to the discard pile.

### **7. The Discard Pile and its Rules**

* **When discarding cards:** You cannot discard a card that would help opponents easily form melds.
  > **Example:** If the top card of the discard pile is `10♦`, you cannot discard `10♠` (which could form a Set) or `9♦` (which could form a Run). Discard an unrelated card like `3♥`.

* **When taking the entire pile:** If the discard pile has 9 or fewer cards, you can take all of them. However, if you take them, you must form and place a meld on the table during that turn.
  > **Penalty:** If you cannot form a meld after taking the pile, you receive a **25-point penalty**, and the cards must be returned to where they were.

### **8. How Scoring Works**

* **If you win the round:** You get 0 points!
* **If other players lose:** Points are calculated by adding the values of remaining cards in their hands.
  > **Example:** When the round ends, a losing player has `A♠, 5♥, Q♦` in hand. Their score is `1 + 5 + 12 = 18`.

* **If you're 'Sallan' with Potter cards in hand:** If a 'Sallan' player loses, they receive a **25-point penalty** for each 'Potter' card remaining in their hand.
  > **Example:** A 'Sallan' player has `K♣` and one 'Potter' card in hand. Their score is `13 (K) + 25 (Potter penalty) = 38`.

### **9. Special Rules**

* **Infinite Loop:** If all players keep discarding the same cards repeatedly and the game gets stuck, the system detects this. The card that caused the loop is returned to the player who discarded it, and that card is banned from being discarded again. This breaks the loop and allows the game to continue.
* **When the draw pile is empty:** The discard pile cards are reshuffled and used as a new draw pile.

### **10. Who Wins the Game?**

* After several rounds, when someone's total score exceeds the target score (200), the game ends.
* Finally, **the player with the lowest score** wins the entire game!
